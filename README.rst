bigmath
=======

A library of common math functions and constants for `golang <https://golang.org/>`_ `math/big <https://golang.org/pkg/math/big/>`_.

**Mathematical Constants**

- `E <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)>`_
- `Phi <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio>`_

**Mathematical Functions**

- `Ceil <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions>`_
- `Floor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions>`_
- `Round <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding>`_
- `Odd <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_and_odd_functions#Odd_functions>`_
- `Sqrt <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method>`_

This project was started because we needed mathematical constants with arbitrary precision. The functions are implemented with the intention of being readable, understandable, and correct rather than fast. Implementations of faster algorithms are planned in the future.

If you've found a bug, open an issue. If you'd like to contribute a new function or have a more efficient implementation of an existing function, feel free to submit a pull request.
